#Lessen

This the website application for a 'Lessen' user. This is an online e-commerce marketplace where users can donate and purchase products.

Steps to run: The website has been hosted on AWS @http://54.187.80.226/

Users can browse the website, and can signup/login for donations and purchases.

Products are sold in two flavours: 
1) Auction sale- Users can bid for the products available. At the end of 4 days, the person with the highest bid amount, takes the product home.
2) Direct sale- Some items which are for direct sale, can be added to the cart directly and checkedout instantly.

All the active development/issue tracking has taken place @https://github.com/sandeepchawan/Lessen

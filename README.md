### Introduction

“According to a recent survey, the number of prospective donors decreases just because
they have to go to a donation camp or NGO to donate the items. Since, everyone wants
to save the trouble of visiting NGO, the items end up getting  dumped outside
the house which could have been used by a needy, had there been a platform.”

This project implementation focuses on selling the donated items with less operational cost. This can be attained by proving same platform to donors and buyers where donors will upload images of items they wish to donate using mobile app or website portal. Once these items are approved by the admin, these donated items are visible to other users/buyers for buying at a minimal cost.  





###Problem Statement:

Savers/goodwill/salvation army buys the donated items from local NGO’s which requires storage cost, maintenance cost and logistics cost. This results in increased operational cost since they have to keep all these items in their store till they are sold. Also, since there is no proper way of arranging items, it takes a lot of time for the store as well as the buyer to look for items they are interested in. Since, there is no inventory maintained by the thrift stores, it is difficult to track the items.

###Solution:

Through this implementation our goal is to minimize operational cost by providing a platform where donor can upload item and buyer can look for items he is interested in. If both donation and purchase doesn’t happen within some time frame, admin notifies the logistics team to pick up the donated item from donor’s place.

##Implementation:

The solution was implemented using Mean Stack for website and Android studio for mobile
app. The application is hosted on AWS 



###Procedures:

Our approach to minimize operational cost involves implementing a portal as a platform for donors and buyers to upload items to be donated by donors and their prospective buyer to look into same platform. Admin keeps track of the donations made by area, if there are multiple donations from a area, admin creates donation event so that both donor and buyer can come to donation drive and items will be sold on the same day hence by reducing operation cost. These events will be posted on social media and also on website portal where every user can look for upcoming events.   




###Usecases:

- A **_donor_**, can donate any item using mobile application or through website.
- A **_buyer_**, can buy any item from a mobile application or through website.
- An **_organisation or administration_**, will act as an intermediate between the buyer and donor.


### Mobile Application  

Mobile Application User Interface:
User can perform the following tasks from mobile:
-Upload an item for bidding
-Bid for a product
-Get event notification

##Results:

By creating a website portal and mobile app, we will be able to bring the donor and buyer closer. Also, by analyzing and tracking the donations made depending on city, admin can create donation events. This will result in reduced operational cost as items donated will get sold the same day excluding the need to gather items from donors, storage and maintenance costs .

Conclusions:

So the idea is to implement a platform which brings donors and buyers together and to generate  revenue from items donated with lowest operating costs.
